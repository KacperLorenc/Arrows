# Arrows

For game instruction run it and press info button in main menu.

This application generates 4 ArrowArrays with random chars that represent arrows.
Next, program checks every arrow - the direction it points at and the position of its array (LEFT, UP, RIGHT, DOWN).
Based on that information it fills the NumbersArray with numbers - every value of cell
of the table is incremented by one, when one arrows points at it. Then the application creates a group of diffrent nodes,
one type holds numerical values that represent NumbersArray, and the other type are ArrowNodes. To win, arrows in ArrowNodes
need to match those that generated NumbersArray and are being stored in ArrowArrays. Player can run new game, save game, load game
and create custom maps.
